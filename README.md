Pktgen version 2.4.0 using DPDK-1.5.2
=====================================

**Pktgen is a traffic generator powered by Intel's DPDK at 10Gbit wire rate traffic with 64 byte frames.**

**Sounds like 'Packet-Gen'**

**=== Modifications ===**
 - 2.4.1   - Fixed a bug in range packets when 'inc' value is zero use start values.
 - 2.4.0   - Add support for TX tap packets. Change 'tap' command to rxtap and txtap.
 - 2.3.4   - Minor update to help eliminate RX errors and be able to receive at wire rate.
 - 2.3.3   - Update to minor release 1.5.2
 - 2.3.2   - Fixed VLAN detection problem in ARP and special GARP support.
 - 2.3.1   - Getting closer to line rate tx speed.
 - 2.3.0   - Now supports the VLAN encapsulated packets for ARP replies
             Also added a special GARP processing to update the destination MAC
             address to help support a special request for failover support.
             Added support for DPDK 1.5.1
 - 2.2.7   - Updated the code to handle multiple TX queues per port.
 - 2.2.6   - Fixed a crash if the port is not up with link status
 - 2.2.5   - Remove the flow control code as some systems it does not work.
 - 2.2.4   - Fix the inet_h64tom and inet_mtoh64 functions to account for endianness
 - 2.2.3   - range packet fixes for packet size and source/destination mac
 - 2.2.2   - Minor performance changes for receive packet performance.
 - 2.2.1   - Change MAC address from XXXX:XXXX:XXXX to XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX format
             Fixed Pktgen to allow packet changes without having to restart the tool.
 - 2.2.0   - Update to DPDK 1.5.0

README for setting up Pktgen with DPDK on Ubuntu 10.04 to 12.10 desktop, it
should work on most Linux systems as long as the kernel has hugeTLB support.

```
Note: Tested with Ubuntu 12.10 kernel version
Linux 3.5.0-25-generic #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 25 18:26:58 UTC 2013 x86_64
```

I am using Ubuntu 12.10 x86_64 (64 bit support) for running pktgen/DPDK on a
Westmere Dual socket board running at 2.4GHz with 12GB of ram 6GB per socket.
The current kernel version is 3.5.0-25 (as of 2013-03-18) support, but should
work on just about any new Linux kernel version.

To get hugeTLB support your Linux kernel must be at least 2.6.33 and in the
DPDK documents it talks about how you can upgrade your Linux kernel.

The pktgen output display needs 132 columns and about 42 lines to display
correctly. I am using an xterm of 132x42, but you can have a larger display
and maybe a bit smaller. If you are displaying more then 4-6 ports then you
will need a wider display. The pktgen allows you to view a set ports if they
do not all fit on the screen at one time via the 'page' command in pktgen.
Type 'help' at the 'pktgen>' prompt to see the complete pktgen commands.
Pktgen uses VT100 control codes or escape codes to display the screens,
which means your terminal must support VT100. The Hyperterminal in windows is not
going to work for Pktgen as it has a few problems with VT100 codes.

The pktgen program as built can send up to 16 packets per port in a sequence
and you can configure a port using the 'seq' pktgen command. A script file
can be loaded from the shell command line via the -f option and you can 'load'
a script file from within pktgen as well.

Packet Buffer types and usages:
-------------------------------

Pktgen has four different sets of packet buffers to be used for a given type of
data to be sent on the wire per port. The four buffer types are single packet, 
16 sequence packets, range packets and PCAP packet buffers.

The single packet buffer is defined by the information on the main screen. Each port
in the system has a column of information on the screen to each single packet. The
information toward the bottom of the column is the IP address, port numbers and MAC
addresses for the single packet. When you do a 'start N' command and you have not
setup any other type of packets to send on that port it will send the packet defined
on the screen.

The next type of buffers are the sequence packets, which is a set of packet (up to 16)
for each port. Each port can have a different set of sequence packets or be able to
send other types of packets like single packet type. If you execute the command 'page seq'
it will display the port 0 sequence packets and using the command 'port X' you can change
to another port while in the sequence screen. Also using the set <portlist> seqCnt <value>
command you can assign 1 to 16 different packets to the port. Using the commands you can
set a given sequence packet information for a given port. The command starts with 'seq'
and you can look at the help screen to determine the command usage.

The next type of packet buffers is the range packets. The user is allowed to set up
ranges for the packets by adjusting the values or ranges for a number of fields in the
packet like IP address, MAC address, port numbers, packet sizes and a number of other
options. Using the range command 'page range' you can look at the port values the range
packets for a given port and using 'port X' to switch to different ports. This option
needs to be enabled per port just like sequence packets must be enabled. The flags
value at the top of the screen on each port help the user to see how they are configured.

The last type of packet buffers is the PCAP packets. Pktgen will load a PCAP file from
the command line for a given port using X:filename.pcap where X is the port number. To
have Pktgen send the PCAP file you must also enable the port to send that PCAP file. You
can switch from one type of packet buffer to another at will and Pktgen will remember
the configuration of the other packet buffers in the system. If you want to save the
configuration you need to a 'save' command to write the configuration to a file. You can
then load that file again using the load command or place it on the command line.
